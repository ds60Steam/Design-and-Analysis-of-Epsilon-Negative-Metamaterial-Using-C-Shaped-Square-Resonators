# Design-and-Analysis-of-Epsilon-Negative-Metamaterial-Using-C-Shaped-Square-Resonators
Designed and simulated a compact epsilon-negative (ENG) metamaterial unit cell using C-shaped square resonators on Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 substrate, optimized for S-, C-, and X-band applications.

Utilized CST Studio Suite 2025 to analyze S-parameters (S11, S21) and retrieve effective permittivity and permeability, confirming multiband resonance and ENG behavior.

Demonstrated scalability through a 4Ã—4 unit cell array, showcasing potential for 5G Wi-Fi, radar, and satellite communication systems with strong resonance, low reflection, and ease of fabrication.
